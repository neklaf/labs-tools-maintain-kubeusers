## Automate the process of generating user credentials for Toolforge Kubernetes

 - Get a list of all the users from LDAP
 - Get a list of namespaces/configmaps in k8s for each toolforge user
 - Do a diff, find new users and users with deleted configmaps
 - For each new user or removed configmap:
    - Create new namespace (only for a new user)
    - generate a CSR (including the right group for RBAC/PSP)
    - Validate and approve the CSR
    - Drop the .kube/config file in the tool directory
    - Annotate the namespace with configmap
